TIMELINE DELIVERABLE REQUEST
Please create a comprehensive development schedule that includes:
Phase Breakdown

Project Setup & Planning Phase

Environment configuration
Repository setup
Initial architecture decisions
Development tool setup

Core Development Phases

Frontend development timeline
Backend development timeline
Integration milestones
Feature-specific development blocks

Testing & Quality Assurance

Unit testing schedules
Integration testing periods
User acceptance testing
Bug fixing buffers

Deployment & Launch

Production environment setup
Deployment preparation
Go-live activities
Post-launch monitoring

Detailed Requirements for Each Phase:
Time Allocation Specifics:

Provide percentage breakdown of time for frontend vs backend
Include buffer time for unexpected challenges (recommend 15-20%)
Account for testing and debugging phases
Schedule code review and refactoring periods

Feature Development Priority:

Arrange features by dependency relationships
Identify which features can be developed in parallel
Highlight critical path items that could delay the project
Suggest MVP vs full-feature delivery options

Risk Management:

Identify potential bottlenecks in the timeline
Suggest contingency plans for common delays
Recommend checkpoints for progress evaluation
Include time for stakeholder reviews and feedback incorporation

ADAPTIVE SCHEDULING OPTIONS
Please also provide:
Option A: Conservative Timeline

Includes generous buffer time
Lower risk of delays
Suitable for teams with less experience

Option B: Aggressive Timeline

Minimal buffer time
Requires experienced developers
Higher risk but faster delivery

Option C: Phased Release Timeline

MVP delivery first
Feature increments in subsequent releases
Allows for early user feedback

DELIVERABLE FORMAT PREFERENCES
Timeline Presentation:

Weekly breakdown with specific tasks
Gantt chart style scheduling
Milestone markers and dependencies
Resource allocation recommendations

Include practical guidance for:

Daily/weekly task organization
Progress tracking methods
Team coordination (if applicable)
Quality checkpoints
Deployment readiness criteria

PROJECT CONSTRAINTS & CONSIDERATIONS
Technical Constraints:
[Any specific limitations, integrations, or requirements]
Resource Constraints:
[Budget limitations, tool restrictions, etc.]
External Dependencies:
[Third-party services, client approvals, data sources]
Quality Standards:

EXPECTED OUTPUT
A comprehensive project timeline that includes:

Week-by-week development schedule
Task dependencies and critical path analysis
Resource allocation recommendations
Risk mitigation strategies
Quality assurance integration
Deployment preparation timeline
Post-launch support planning

Please ensure the timeline is realistic, accounts for potential delays, and includes specific actionable tasks that can be tracked and measured throughout the development process.
