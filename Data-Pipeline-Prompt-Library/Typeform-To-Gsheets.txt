Typeform → Google Sheets Pipeline
(Used in Project 4)

Project Goal: Build a Google Apps Script automation system that creates a unified data pipeline for Typeform → Google Sheets integration with a centralized dashboard.

Core Requirements:

1. Automated Data Retrieval System
Connect to Typeform API to automatically pull CSV data from End-of-Sprint (EOS) surveys
Trigger options: Manual button click, scheduled intervals, or webhook-based
Handle multiple survey forms simultaneously

2.Data Processing Pipeline
Clean and standardize incoming CSV data (handle formatting inconsistencies, normalize text responses)
Transform data into consistent structure across all surveys
Validate data integrity and handle missing/malformed entries

3.Centralized Mega Database (Google Sheets)
Create master tracking sheet with columns:
- Sprint Name
- Source Sheet Link (cleaned data destination)
- Response Count
- Date Created/Last Updated
- Processing Status ("Complete", "In Progress", "Failed")
- Action Button (trigger data retrieval for specific sprint)

4.Individual Data Sheets
- Each survey gets its own Google Sheet with cleaned, processed data
- Maintain consistent column structure across all sheets
- Include metadata (source survey ID, processing timestamp)

Technical Specifications:
- Use Google Apps Script with Typeform API integration
- Implement error handling and logging for failed retrievals
- Create custom menu/UI for manual operations
- Set up automated triggers for scheduled runs
- Include data backup functionality

Key Features to Implement:
- Bulk export capability (retrieve all responses after sprint completion)
- One-click update system for the mega database
- Status tracking and error notifications
- Data validation and quality checks

Stretch Goals:
- Extend system to handle other survey types with structure harmonization
- Integration with existing PowerPoint automation workflow
- Real-time sync capabilities

Current Pain Point to Solve: Eliminate manual CSV extraction from Typeform and streamline the entire data flow into the existing automated reporting system.
